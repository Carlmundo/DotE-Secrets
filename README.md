# Dungeon of the Endless - Secret Unlocker
An easy to install patch to unlock [secret characters](https://dungeon-of-the-endless.fandom.com/wiki/Heroes#Secret), adding them to the character selection screen.

## Install
[Download the latest version](https://github.com/Carlmundo/DotE-Secrets/releases) or download [this file](https://github.com/Carlmundo/DotE-Secrets/raw/master/Patch/Assembly-CSharp.dll) and copy it to DungeonoftheEndless_Data\Managed inside your game folder.

Running the installer will rename your original Assembly-CSharp.dll file to Assembly-CSharp.dll.backup

## Characters
### Ayairi Whairydd (War Pug)
Normally the only way to play as them is to select the random hero option and hope for the best. You can now select Ayairi any time.

### Esseb Tarosh (Archivist)
Can be unlocked without the patch but only by playing on January 21-25 and surviving 3 floors with them. Now they will always be selectable regardless of date.
